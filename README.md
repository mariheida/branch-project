# branch-project

In general, I would store these data in a database. This would allow
easy query access and for a more efficient implementation. For the 
scope of this project, however, I have chosen to read all the files 
and store the data in dictionaries, since there are only 400 users 
and I am expected to work on it for 4-5 hours.

I have chosen to write it in an ipython notebook for it's visual appeal:
being able to show some data samples, plots, and my comments.

This code requires the data to be placed in a directory named 'data', 
one level above this code.
